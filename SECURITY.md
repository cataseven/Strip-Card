## Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
I take the security of my project seriously. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security vulnerabilities you find.

1. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps:
2. Do not open a public issue on the repository.
3. Email your findings to cenkataseven@hotmail.com with a detailed description of the vulnerability.
4. Include steps to reproduce the issue.

If possible, provide a proof-of-concept (POC) to demonstrate the vulnerability.

I will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and will provide a more detailed response within 7 business days. I will keep you informed about the progress of my investigation and any remediation steps I take.

My Commitment
I am committed to addressing all security vulnerabilities in a timely manner. I will work to release a patch or new version as quickly as possible.

I believe in responsible disclosure and request that you do not disclose any vulnerability to the public until it has been patched and a new version has been released.

Thank you for helping to keep this project secure.
